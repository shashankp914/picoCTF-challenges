Go to the link and for inspecting the website, Right click on it and click on the inspect.
here, you have to go to the application tab( i.e. present on dock tab after various option like Element,console...etc).
afer that, go to the cookies option!

By analyzing, the html body, we can see that it has name of the cookie **name** and it has various value!
so, we have to check it for different value.
after, checking thoroughly, we came across value **18** where we get the flag.

***ANOTHER METHOD***
There is another method to attack on the website with intruder method in burpsuite, select the payload type **NUMBERS**
So, put the number from 1 to 30(the logic behind these numbers is, there are mainly 25 to 30 type of cookie so we get the flag in any one of them only.)
finally, start the attack and if you check number **18** will have different size and by seeing the response, you get the flag!
